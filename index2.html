	My family has had a dog in the family since I was very little. We have had one golden retriever and currently own two west highland terriers. So why two terriers? Theres a very simple explanation for that, they are the cutest dog in the world! 
	One's name is Mr. Shadow who is nine, and the others name is Henry. Mr. Shadow is the more traveled one we have taken him on a bunch of different vacations all over the country like, San Jose, New York, and Florida. Henry doesn't travel well so we usually leave him at home.
