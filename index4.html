In my family I have and older pair of twins as siblings, Matthew and Melissa. Melissa goes to Umass lowell, and Matt goes to Umass Amherst. They are one year older than me and sophomores at their colleges. My mom works at a regulatory affairs office in San Jose California where she lives with my Dad and dogs. Here you can see some of the pictures we took on our vacation to the Virgin Islands we took this summer.
